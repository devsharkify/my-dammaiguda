- **New Frontend:** , , , , , 
- **New Assets:** All files within  and .
- **Heavily Modified:** , , 

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The white-labeling configuration (, ) has been created, but it needs to be systematically integrated into all components that display area-specific information or branding (e.g., , ) to make the white-labeling fully functional. The agent only provided a conceptual example.

**key api endpoints**
-  (POST): **New.** Uploads an image file to Cloudinary and returns the secure URL.
-  (POST): **New.** Tracks a user behavior event.
-  (POST): **New.** Handles user account deletion requests.
-  (GET): **Modified.** Now includes  and prioritizes pinned news.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **The immediate and highest priority task is guiding the user through the production deployment.** The user has purchased the domain  and needs to deploy the app from the newly created GitHub repository to Railway, using MongoDB Atlas for the database. A detailed plan has already been communicated to the user.
- **Do not use preview URLs for anything related to the Play Store.** The user has been clearly instructed on this. All store-facing URLs must use the final  domain.
- The app is structured for white-labeling. If the user asks to create a version for a new area, use the  file as the central point for customization.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
  -  (updated)
  - All test reports from  calls.
  - Play Store assets generated in  and .
